In a 2d surface, where the category that is inhereted is space, a vertex of a graph should be considered an area. A child of a vertex is then a subarea. If two areas overlap, then the area that overlaps can be considered as a child of two parents. It is therefore multi-parent, Directed, and Acyclic.

In a 2d surface where it is not possible to overlap, the graph can be considered to be Single Parent, Directed and Acyclic
